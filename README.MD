GearSwap User Files by Lorand

Recent changes (as of June 2016) are experimental, and have not been fully tested!

Please keep backups of your existing files before switching to new versions of mine!

I now require new, additional libraries that can be found here: https://github.com/lorand-ffxi/lor_libs

Instructions for where to place the new libraries are in their readme.

The new libraries are not finalized yet, so please update them when you update these files.
